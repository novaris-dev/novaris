title: "Welcome to Novaris"

So, you’ve gone ahead and installed Novaris — a minimalist framework for flat-file websites. Bold move. But here’s the thing: if you’re not ready to deal with the quirks and hiccups (and trust me, they’re coming), you might want to rethink this decision. No? Still sticking around? Respect.

Alright, let’s dive in.

The homepage content lives in the /user/content/index.md file. Yep, it’s really that simple. Want to whip up a new page at yoursite.com/about? Just drop a file in /user/content/about.md. Feeling fancy? You can even structure it with sub-directories, like /user/content/about/index.md.

Novaris keeps things lean, but you’ll need to keep it in line. Ready for the ride?
